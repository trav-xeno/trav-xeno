## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 

 I am currently working full time for an electrical company in a multi developer role, which means I handle web, desktop, and libary codebases. I tend to dabble in a verity of technologies and programming languages. Since I dabble I don't tend to consider myself a master of anything I do. I just do it so I can get a beter perspective on different technologies and techniques. So far the technologies I enjoy using in no real order are, docker/Bun/Kotlin(mobile apps)/Go/TS/Python/Rust/React/SurrealDB/Vue/svelte/Bevy(rust game engine)/nim/grain(WASM)/C++/Zig/Elixir/C#..F#(.net desktop apps/web).    


Note: Since I've taken programming classes at tutfts I have work saved to a private repo for them if you wish to see the work I have done please contact me! I have some major projects in mind that I will be adding in coming year(when I have time) so stay tuned!     


* ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working at Hubbell
* ðŸŽ† Iâ€™m currently learning VR/AR design concepts and implementation of course I can't stop keeping an eye on Js/TS tech shifts, python 3.13(GIL part is pretty interesting), Tauti 2.0, Zig/Rust libary and ecosystems   
* ðŸ’» Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on Rust, Zig, Go, F#, Swift, and Kotlin projects 
* ðŸ“« How to reach me: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/travis-nevins/">LinkedIn</a> and message me.

### Side projects
