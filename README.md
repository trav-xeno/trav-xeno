## Hi there ðŸ‘‹  ![Visitor Count](https://profile-counter.glitch.me/trav-xeno/count.svg)

 I am currently a CS student at Tufts working towards a MS degree.I tend to dabble in a verity of technologies and programming languages. Since I dabble I don't tend to consider myself a master of anything I do. I just do it so I can get a beter perspective on different technologies and techniques. So far the technologies I enjoy using have been, docker/Kotlin/Go/TS/Python/Rust/React/SurrealDB/Vue/svelte/bevy/nim/grain(WASM)/c++/C#.    


Note: Since I am taking classes I have work saved to a private repo for Class if you wish to see the work I have done thus far in my classes please contact me! I have some major projects in mind that I willbe adding in coming year(when I have time) so stay tuned!
